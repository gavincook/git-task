No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, wonâ€™t make you cry.
Remember what should be remembered, and forget what should be forgotten.Alter what is changeable, and accept what is unchangeable.
Love is like a butterfly. It goes where it pleases and it pleases where it goes.
If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.
her wishful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night.
